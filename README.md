Brain auditory impairment application

GOAL/PURPOSE
Last researches in neurobiology show the amazing power of our brain. 
Leading scientist in this area have already proved the brain plasticity â€“ it is a brain ability 
to recover and restructure under the influence of outside information input. 
They show how some special exercises can change damaged brain on physical layer.
There are many children/people nowadays with the impairment in auditory cognitive abilities 
(and their amount is increasing over time) on speech understanding layer.
Between this people and last researches there is steel a big gap unfortunately, special in russian-language society.
So the main idea of this project is to link this people with such problems/necessities and last science results in this area to help them.

Mandatory. AMOUNT OF TARGET USERS.
Statistic show that approximately 5-10% people have such problems. 
There are no one such russian language application/trainer for this ability yet. 
Russian speaking population is about 160 million people. So the count of potential users is about 12 million people.

Availability of business people or subject matter experts capacity to support the project during its lifecycle:
there are group of russian scientist who work in this field and ready to support this project in semantic questions.

Technologies
Server side: Java/Kotlin + Spring (rest api for front)
DB: Postgres
Front-end : up to front-end developers 
Using some libraries which are working with audio information
