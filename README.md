Brain auditory impairment application

## Goal / Purpose

Last researches in neurobiology show the amazing power of our brain.

Leading scientist in this area have already proved the brain plasticity â€“ it is a brain ability 
to recover and restructure under the influence of outside information input. 
They show how some special exercises can change damaged brain on physical layer.
There are many children/people nowadays with the impairment in auditory cognitive abilities 
(and their amount is increasing over time) on speech understanding layer.
Between this people and last researches there is steel a big gap unfortunately, special in russian-language society.

So the main idea of this project is to link this people with such problems/necessities and last science results in this area to help them.

## Mandatory. AMOUNT OF TARGET USERS.

Statistic show that approximately 5-10% people have such problems. 

There are no one such russian language application/trainer for this ability yet. 

Russian speaking population is about 160 million people. So the count of potential users is about 12 million people.

Availability of business people or subject matter experts capacity to support the project during its lifecycle:
there are group of russian scientist who work in this field and ready to support this project in semantic questions.

## Technologies
Server side: Java/Kotlin + Spring boot (rest api for front).
DB: Postgres (h2 on development now).
Front-end : up to front-end developers - angular / react.
Using some libraries which are working with audio information.

## Original notes for Vaadin Flow to be used together with Spring Boot

This project can be used as a starting point to create your own Vaadin Flow application with Spring Boot.
It contains all the necessary configuration and some placeholder files to get you started.

The best way to use it by via [vaadin.com/start](https://vaadin.com/start) - you can get only the necessary parts and choose the package naming you want to use.

Import the project to the IDE of your choosing as a Maven project. 

Run application using `mvn spring-boot:run` or directly running Application class from your IDE. 

Open http://localhost:8080/ in browser

If you want to run your app locally in the production mode, run `mvn spring-boot:run -Pproduction`.
