## Original notes for Vaadin Flow to be used together with Spring Boot

This project can be used as a starting point to create your own Vaadin Flow application with Spring Boot.
It contains all the necessary configuration and some placeholder files to get you started.

The best way to use it by via [vaadin.com/start](https://vaadin.com/start) - you can get only the necessary parts and choose the package naming you want to use.

Import the project to the IDE of your choosing as a Maven project. 

Run application using `mvn spring-boot:run` or directly running Application class from your IDE. 

Open http://localhost:8080/ in browser

If you want to run your app locally in the production mode, run `mvn spring-boot:run -Pproduction`.

For documentation on using Vaadin Flow and Spring, visit [vaadin.com/docs](https://vaadin.com/docs/flow/spring/tutorial-spring-basic.html)
